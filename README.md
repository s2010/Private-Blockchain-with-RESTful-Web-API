# Private Blockchain with RESTful Web API
This is Project 3, This project will help establish a RESTful version of Web API whereby a client will be able to call REST end points for reading (GETing) and adding (POSTing) new blocks in the blockchain. A framework (levelDB) will enable the permanent storage persistance of block data with all necessary formalities (block hashing, height and chaining previous hash etc.). Project has been coded using Node JS libraries.
